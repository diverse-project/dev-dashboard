# dev-dashboard
The tracker of this repository is used to track development requests so we can improve internal collaboration by organizing code sprints in the team.

The main idea is to organize coding sprint (typically involving engineers of the team) on request of the scientific members (permanent, post doc and Phd student ).


Typical sprint granurality will be 2 weeks.

The tracker should also list the task related to contractual projects in order to also provide a coarse grain view of the engineers activities. (same grain as the sprints)

# Synthetic view
We are still investigating weither is is better to use github Projects of waffle.io to present a synthesis of the board.
- Github project is easier to find thanks to links in the UI but requires to manually add issues in the board, Example: https://github.com/diverse-project/dev-dashboard/projects/1  
- waffle.io offers a seamless way to add issues in the board, and uses labels but is an external service. Example: https://waffle.io/diverse-project/dev-dashboard
