# dev-dashboard
The tracker of this repository is used to track development requests so we can improve internal collaboration by organizing code sprints in the team.

The main idea is to organize coding sprint (typically involving engineers of the team but not only them :wink: ) on request of the scientific members (permanent, post doc and Phd student ).


Typical sprint granurality will be 2 weeks.

The tracker should also list the task related to contractual projects in order to also provide a coarse grain view of the engineers activities. (same grain as the sprints)
